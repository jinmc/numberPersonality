# numberPersonality

This is my first ever program.
It was written in Python, by 9/3, 2015.

It was a class project.
The purpose of it is to set the limit(here it is 100)
and iterate until it to know all the properties of the numbers from 1 to limit.

Test code was written by professor.
Number_personality was written by Jinmo Chong with guidance.
